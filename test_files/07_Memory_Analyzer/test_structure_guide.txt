Memory Analyzer Test Data

This is a placeholder for memory dump analysis.
Real memory dumps are binary files and need to be:
1. Captured from actual systems
2. From forensic investigations
3. From Volatility research datasets
4. From public memory dump collections

Example structure of memory artifacts to detect:
- Shellcode: \x90\x90\x90\xcc (NOP sled + int3)
- Injected PE headers: MZ executable signatures
- Suspicious strings: powershell, cmd, psexec, etc.
- Hook patterns: jmp instructions at function prologues
- Kernel objects: hidden process structures
- Network indicators: socket connections, ports
- File paths: evidence of file access
- Registry paths: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE modifications
- API calls: CreateRemoteThread, VirtualAllocEx patterns

Test files should be:
- At least 1MB in size
- Properly formatted memory dumps
- Include various memory regions (stack, heap, code)
