Media Analyzer Test Samples

This folder should contain actual image/video files for testing.

Sample test cases:
1. Normal JPEG - clean image with standard metadata
2. PNG with steganography - image with hidden data embedded
3. JPEG with appended data - malicious file with executable attached

The analyzer will test:
- Steganography detection (7 methods)
- Hidden content detection (archives, executables)
- Tool signature detection (steghide, OutGuess, OpenStego)
- Color distribution anomalies
- File entropy analysis
- Appended data after image markers
- Metadata extraction
- OCR text extraction
- Video frame analysis
- PDF analysis

To generate test files:
- Use legitimate image/video files as base
- For steganography: use steghide, OutGuess, or manual LSB embedding
- For appended data: concatenate ZIP/EXE after image data
- For normal: just clean photos/screenshots
